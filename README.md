## Backend:

I am using backend which is not a part of Nextjs because it will make this application a even more scalable.

1. Nodejs with Expressjs framework using Prisma to manage our interactions with the Postgresql database

## Deployment:

AWS 

1. Using EC2 for hosting backend 
2.  RDS for postgresql database
